# Deployment

__Installation__

In order to install the project, dowload the files 
then you can simply open *index.html*

__Deployment__

To deploy the project, I used vercel and linked it to a repository on github
Once deployed, I activated Checkly on the repository.
I also activated imgbot on all of my repositories.

__Actions__

By using Zapier, for each new commit in this repository a message is send to a discord server.
I had some troubles with message not appearing in the server because I stripped the Zapier bot
of too many rights including the one to post messages coming from another site.
