#Deployment

To deploy the project, I used vercel.

Once deployed, I activated Checkly on the repository.
I also activated imgbot on all of my repositories.

By using Zapier, for each new commit in this repository a message is send to a discord server.
I had some troubles with message not appearing in the server because I stripped the Zapier bot
of too many rights including the one to post messages coming from another site.
